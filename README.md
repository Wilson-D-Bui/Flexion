# Flexion Coding Development Branch
This branch is used for testing purposes and fulfills the following roles:

1). The branch 'development' is the developer's workspace for seamless implementation and committing of code
2). This branch continuously integrates and deploys code the the TEST server upon commit/push by the developer 
3). Once this branch is in a stable state and ready for release, a pull request can be made to merge into 'master'.
4). Upon successful code review and the code from development is merged into master, Jenkins will deploy the code to the PROD server
